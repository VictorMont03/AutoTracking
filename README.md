# 🚛 Real-Time Vehicle Tracking & Freight Simulation System

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **real-time vehicle tracking and freight simulation system** that integrates **WebSockets**, **Apache Kafka**, and **microservices** to provide seamless communication between services. The system enables:

- **Real-time vehicle tracking** on an interactive map
- **Freight cost simulation** based on dynamic routes
- **Efficient communication** between frontend and backend via WebSockets
- **Event-driven architecture** using **Apache Kafka**
- **Microservices-based backend** using **NestJS** and **Golang**
- **Advanced containerization** with **Docker** for efficient deployment and networking

## 🏗️ Technologies Used

### 🖥️ Frontend

- **Next.js** with WebSockets for real-time updates
- **TailwindCSS** for modern UI styling
- **Google Maps API** for vehicle route visualization

### 🔧 Backend

- **NestJS** (Node.js framework) handling vehicle tracking and WebSockets
- **Golang** service for freight cost calculations
- **Apache Kafka** for asynchronous messaging between services
- **MongoDB** as the primary database

### 📦 Infrastructure

- **Docker** for advanced containerized deployment
- **Docker Compose** for service orchestration
- **Kafka + Zookeeper** setup for message queuing
- **Container networking** for seamless inter-service communication

## ⚙️ System Architecture

1. **Vehicle Tracking Service (NestJS)**:

   - Receives vehicle location updates via WebSockets
   - Publishes location events to Kafka

2. **Freight Calculation Service (Golang)**:

   - Listens to Kafka topics for new tracking events
   - Calculates freight costs based on distance, time, and fuel consumption
   - Sends the calculated cost back through Kafka
	 - Simulate routes

3. **Frontend (React.js + WebSockets)**:

   - Displays real-time vehicle locations on a map
   - Show simulations of drivers

4. **Kafka Broker**:

   - Manages message-based communication between services

5. **MongoDB Database**:

   - Stores vehicle tracking data and freight cost logs

6. **Docker & Networking**:

   - Containers for **frontend, backend services, database, Kafka, and Zookeeper**
   - Ensures efficient communication between services
